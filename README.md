# WebSite for a fictional Company
I create a website about space journey company to train my 
skills with using flexbox for layout and for positioning elements (I know that using flexbox for layout is a bad practice).
I also using media quaries to set determine size for brakpionts. 

## Gadgets and breakpionts

I create adaptive size for: laptop,
tablets and mobiles with different sizes.

I also try to use responsive width and height and try to 
systematize css properties.

## Website
