# WebSite for a fictional Company

I create a website about space journey to train my 
skills with using only flexbox 
(i know that this is a bad practice) and using media quaries 
for creating adaptive size. I create adaptive size for: laptop,
tablets and mobiles with different sizes. 
I also try to use responsive width and height and try to 
systematize css properties.
